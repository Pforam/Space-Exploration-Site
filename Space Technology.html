    <h1>SPACE TECHNOLOGY</h1>
    <p>
        The technology used for travelling or conducting activities beyond  
        the atmosphere of the earth for space exploration or spacecraft is 
        known as Space Technology. Satellites, spacecraft, orbital launch 
        vehicles and space stations, in-space propulsion, deep-space communication, 
        and many other technologies are included in this arena of technological advancement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Space technology refers to the various technologies used for space exploration, 
        satellite communication, and other space-related applications. It encompasses a
        wide range of fields including aerospace engineering, materials science, propulsion 
        systems, robotics, communication systems, remote sensing, and more. Space technology 
        plays a crucial role in enabling human space exploration, studying celestial bodies, 
        monitoring Earth's environment, and improving communication and navigation on Earth.

    <ul>
        <li>In 1962, Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) was established by the Department of Atomic Energy. 
            Work on building the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station(TERLS) began.</li>
        <li>On 21st November 1963, from TERLS, the first rocket was launched.</li>
        <li>In 1967, Satellite Telecommunication Earth Station was constructed in Ahmedabad.</li>
        <li>ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) was formed under the Department of Atomic Energy on 15th August 1969.</li>    
    </ul>
    <p>
        Space technology is constantly evolving and advancing, driven by the needs of space 
        exploration, scientific research, and human missions beyond Earth. These technologies 
        enable us to push the boundaries of our understanding of the universe and pave the way 
        for future space exploration endeavors.
