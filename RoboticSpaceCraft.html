    <h1>ROBOTIC SPACECRAFT</h1>
    <h3>What is a Spacecraft?</h3>
    <p>A spacecraft has a number of essential components, such as an engine, power subsystem, 
        steering system and communications system, in addition to science instruments. 
        Most of these systems are housed in a section called the service module,
        while the science instruments make up the payload module.</p>
    <h3>What is Robotic Spacecraft?</h3>    
    <p>A robotic spacecraft, also known as an unmanned spacecraft or an autonomous spacecraft, 
        is a vehicle designed to explore and travel through outer space without human presence on board. 
        These spacecraft are typically controlled remotely from Earth or are pre-programmed with 
        instructions to carry out their missions autonomously.</p>
    <h3>What is Robotic Spacecraft used for?</h3>   
    <p>Robots help NASA explore the solar system and the universe. Spacecraft that explore
        other worlds, like the moon or Mars, are all robotic. These robots include rovers 
        and landers on the surface of other planets.</p>

        Robotic spacecraft have greatly expanded our understanding of the universe and 
        continue to play a crucial role in space exploration, enabling us to explore 
        distant worlds, study celestial objects, and advance our technological capabilities 
        in the pursuit of scientific knowledge and human curiosity.
