        <p>Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. The exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights and by robotic spacecraft.</p>
        <p>Space exploration has been an important part of human history. The first space exploration began in the 1950s with the launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1. Since then, space exploration has grown in scope and ambition. Today, there are many space exploration missions and programs, such as the International Space Station, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the Mars Exploration Program.</p>
        <p>The goals of space exploration vary from mission to mission. Some missions aim to advance our understanding of the universe, while others seek to explore new worlds and answer questions about the origins of life on Earth. No matter the mission, space exploration is an incredible journey that pushes the boundaries of our knowledge and imagination.</p>
