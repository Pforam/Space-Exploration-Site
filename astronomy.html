            Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe beyond Earth's atmosphere. 
            That includes objects we can see with our naked eyes, like the Sun , the Moon , the planets, and the stars . 
            It also includes objects we can only see with telescopes or other instruments, like faraway galaxies and tiny particles.

            with significant contributions from ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks,
